        <p><i>The Seven Rila Lakes is a group of lakes of glacial origin located in the Rila Mountains . This is the most visited lake group in Bulgaria and is one of the hundred national tourist sites . The lakes are located in the Damga part of the Northwestern Rila and are located stepwise between 2095 and 2535 m above sea level. They occupy depressions on the slope of the mountain, as the individual lakes are connected to each other by small streams. By passing the water in these streams are formed small cascades and waterfalls . The first three lakes - Tear , Eye and Kidney - each drains separately into Gemini , from which the water passes successively through the Shamrock , Fish and Lower Lake . A more powerful stream passes through the last two lakes, which, flowing from the lowest lake, gives rise to the German River (left tributary of the Struma ).

            The name of each of the seven Rila lakes reflects some peculiarity of the respective lake. The lake, which is located at the highest altitude, is called the Tear because of the transparency of the water. Next in height is the Eye (also called the Heart), which is approximately oval in shape. Okoto is the deepest circus lake in Bulgaria - its depth is 37.5 m. Kidney is the lake with the steepest shores of the whole group. The fourth lake is Gemini ; it is the largest of the seven. Lake Trilistnika has an irregular shape and low shores. The shallowest is the Fish Lake ; on its northeast coast is the hut "The Seven Lakes . The lowest is the Lower Lake , from which the German River originates .</i></p>
